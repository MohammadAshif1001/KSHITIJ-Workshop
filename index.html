            <h3>Challenge - Done Using Only HTML and CSS</h3>
            <p>In this assignment, I created the front page of a music library website named Sonic Stack, following the assignment instructions. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16yOI8ehXd1_6IQ396Jhztiqn2O9WE5oa/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Link</a></p>
            <h3>Features Present:</h3>
            <ul style="list-style-type: none; padding: 0;">
                <li  >
                    <h4>Header</h4>
                    <p>In the header section, according to the given task, a logo is present on the left side, and all navigation links are fully responsive. On mobile view, the nav links are hidden, and a hamburger icon is shown. When clicked, the menu items are displayed. Additionally, a modern search bar is present in the nav bar, but it is not functional as JavaScript is not allowed per the instructions. The header section is fixed at the top using z-index, creating an animation-like effect where all website content goes inside on scroll. There is also a toggle button that was my favorite part, allowing the user to change the entire theme of the website.</p>
                </li>
                <li  >
                    <h4>Hero Section</h4>
                    <p>In the Hero Section, I worked according to the instructions. On the left side, there is some text, and on the right side, an SVG icon is present. The SVG is animated using keyframes to vibrate the particles. The hero section is responsive, using flex-wrap and adjusting text sizing and padding with media queries.</p>
                </li>
                <li  >
                    <h4>Featured Playlist Section</h4>
                    <p>In the Featured Playlist section, there are responsive cards. Each card displays the number of songs present in the playlist, the playlist title, a short description, and a button that redirects the user to the corresponding Spotify playlist link, opening in a new tab. (This time, it redirects the user to Spotify, but KTJ has allowed me to create a playlist page and fetch songs using a free API, so I can create a beautiful playlist page.)</p>
                </li>
                <li  >
                    <h4>Recommended Album Section</h4>
                    <p>This section is similar to the Featured Playlist section, with cards displaying album images, titles, short descriptions, and buttons that redirect the user to the corresponding songs on Spotify.</p>
                </li>
                <li  >
                    <h4>Review Section</h4>
                    <p>In the review section, there are two sections. One section displays user reviews, and the second section has a form where users can post their thoughts and share reviews with us.</p>
                </li>
                <li  >
                    <h4>Footer</h4>
                    <p>In the footer, there is a logo, a short description, and a button on the right side that sends the user back to the top of the page with a smooth scrolling effect.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div class="btn" style="display: flex; justify-content: center; margin-top: 20px;">
                <button style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 600; padding: 10px 20px; color: #fff; background-color: #333; border: none; border-radius: 25px; cursor: pointer;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: inherit;" href="Sonic-Stacks/index.html" target="_blank">Check It</a></button>
